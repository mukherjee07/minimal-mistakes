My primary research lies in the intersection of computational simulation methods, machine learning models, and material science. I am deeply interested in applying the right computational methodology to discover stucture-property relationships of material system. In my PhD program, I have been mostly involved in gas-solid systems but I am open to investigate other systems as well. Some of the projects I have been involved are listed below (For publications please refer to the publication page):

### Active learning for efficient navigation of multi-component gas adsorption landscapes in MOFs (Under Peer Review)
* Designed a Active learning workflow to predict gas mixture adsorption in MOFs (CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>, Xe-Kr, and H<sub>2</sub>S-CO<sub>2</sub>).
* Developed an accuracy-based protocol as a stoppage criteria for the Active learning on gas mixture
adsorption in MOFs for a pressure-mole fraction and also for pressure-mole fraction-temperature phase
space (CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>, Xe-Kr, and H<sub>2</sub>S-CO<sub>2</sub>). For more details, visit the github page of the project.
