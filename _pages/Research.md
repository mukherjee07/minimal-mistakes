My primary research lies in the intersection of computational simulation methods, machine learning models, and material science. I am deeply interested in applying the right computational methodology to discover stucture-property relationships of material system. In my PhD program, I have been mostly involved in gas-solid systems but I am open to investigate other systems as well. Some of the projects I have been involved are listed below (For publications please refer to the publication page):

### Active learning for efficient navigation of multi-component gas adsorption landscapes in MOFs (Under Peer Review)
* Designed a Active learning workflow to predict gas mixture adsorption in MOFs (CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>, Xe-Kr, and H<sub>2</sub>S-CO<sub>2</sub>).
* Developed an accuracy-based protocol as a stoppage criteria for the Active learning on gas mixture
adsorption in MOFs for a pressure-mole fraction and also for pressure-mole fraction-temperature phase
space (CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>, Xe-Kr, and H<sub>2</sub>S-CO<sub>2</sub>). For more details, visit the github page of the project.

### Sequential design of Pure component adsorption simulation in MOFs
* Implemented an Active learning protocol (using Gaussian Process regressions) to predict CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption in a Cu-BTC metal-organic framework (MOF) for a temperature-pressure phase space, and demonstrated a reduction of 97-98% of the total data requirement with comparable accuracy to high-fidelity monte carlo simulations.

### Discovery of nanoporous materials for a multi-purpose gas sensor from the CoRE MOF database (collaborated with Jack Gonzalez)
* Led and assisted an undergraduate student, Jack Gonzalez, to calculate selectivity of 30 gas mixtures (all combinations of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O) on the CoRE-MOF database (> 9000 structures), performed the structure-property analysis, and recommended MOF candidates for gas sensing.
