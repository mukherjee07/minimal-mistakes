<h1>Hello!</h1>

* I am a Chemical Engineer with interest in materials discovery and process optimization using molecular modeling, mathematical modeling, optimization, and machine learning. 

* As a driven and detailed-oriented person, I like the idea of using computers to study physical systems and then discover materials/conditions/properties of interest. Experiments inherently carry many limitations (although we certainly need them!) such as challenges in creating a specific condition, synthesis of some rare material, scaling a method to large feature-space, or perhaps cost. Therefore simulations and mathematical modeling are amazing tools that helps us to fill this gap.

* My current research at University of Notre Dame is focused on applying molecular simulations (monte carlo and molecular dynamics), machine learning, and statistics to understand adsorption, selectivity, and other properties in nanoporous systems.

* I have communicated my research work through speaking at conferences, publications in journals, and of course many academic meetings.

* If I have to list my expertise, I'd start with molecular simulations of nanoporous systems, first-principle calculations of small molecules, machine learning models applied to materials, and mathematical modeling and optimization.

* Below I have tried to summarize some major research topics and related skills I gained in the past.:
